window._resetFileSystem()

    TO DO
    - Snake Equation too hard, score not updating
    - make version numbers in About, Boot, and Options/Settings automatically update when the variable is updated
    - military time for clocks
    - pretend battery beside clock Display, pretend WiFi system
        - pretend browser and webpages
            I'm making a pretend OS. It's retro Window/vaporwave themed. I want to create a "browser" that, when opened, defaults to our custom "homepage", which would be a fictional search engine--Snoogle. The browser would need a similar UI, including File/Options/Help menus similar to our file explorer windows; it would need an address bar, back/forward/refresh/home buttons, and maybe "favorites" and "history". We would need to make it modular like our other apps within this OS; I also want the ability to type in "addresses" in the address bar that would load custom pretend webpages that we'd make separately. We'll also be making a pretend internet/wifi for our OS, and when it's "disconnected", the browser would need to show a no network error page. 
    - color themes
    - b-bomb app
    - EX Abbi Code - pretend coder, cat themed
    - math games
    - messenger - hook up to Gemini, generate messages
    - should put all games that arent "system games" in Games folder with custom icons
        - ability to "uninstall" non-system games, with installers kept in System/Installers folder
        - fix desktop grid; allow non-system files and programs to have desktop shortcuts
        - all programs are .abbi file type
    - when creating new folder, needs to let me rename by default
    - run programs from DUCK
